# Monaco Editor for MODX

This is a simple package that adds the Monaco Editor to MODX. It is a simple wrapper around the Monaco Editor, 
which is a browser-based code editor that powers Visual Studio Code. 

## Installation

To install this package, simply install it via the MODX package manager. You can find it by searching for "Monaco MODX".

## Usage

To use the Monaco Editor, adjust your system settings for `which_element_editor` to "Monaco". 

## Customization

The Monaco Editor currently ships with two themes: "vs", "vs-dark" and "hc-black". These can be changed in the system 
settings under `monaco.theme`.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Fred integration

  - [X] Syntax highlighting
